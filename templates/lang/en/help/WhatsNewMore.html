<h3>Settings: Send Update Notification for 'My Starred Items'</h3>

<p>By default, we send email for your starred items when it's updated by others.<br />
So that we don't need to check site again and again to check if there is any updates.</p>

<p>For God's sake, you can disable that to avoid annoying email notification when u get tried.</p>

<p>Now everyone can <a href="/forum/create">Create a Forum</a> at any time any where.<br />
   No stricts. No warnings.<br />
   Just have fun!
